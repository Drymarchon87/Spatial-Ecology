Spatial Ecology of Gila Monsters in a Nutrient Subsidized Environment

Abstract:
Animal movements are often defined using the home range concept.  Consequently, home ranges are determined by temporal, spatial, and individual-level processes.  Within the environment, one of the key factors influencing an animal’s range and how it uses the environment is that of resources.  Alterations to the environment that affect resource distribution and availability can have profound consequences on an animal’s spatial patterns.  One of the best examples of this is that of golf courses.  Some environmental modifications exhibited by some human altered environment can have positive effects on certain wildlife species by altering their movement patterns and foraging efforts.  We analyzed data collected from 22 Gila Monsters Heloderma suspectum at a subsidized environment in Arizona from 2007 to 2013 and a non-subsidized environment.  We performed both kernel density estimation and minimum convex polygons for comparability purposes.  After adjusting for sex, number of fixes, and year, males in the subsidized environment had an average area of 15.9 ha while the females had an area of 5.9 ha.  In the un-subsidized environment males had an average range of 38.8 ha while females had an area of 29.8 ha.  This suggests that the home ranges may be smaller in subsidized environments than those of un-subsidized environments due to increases in available resources. There were also differences in home range overlap within and between sexes. In the subsidized population, there was very little male-male overlap with only two occurances, more female-female overlap and male-female overlap was increased. Male home ranges often overlapped several female home ranges. Gila Monsters may not have to invest in wide ranging foraging efforts as those populations of the un-subsidized environments.
